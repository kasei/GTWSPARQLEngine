GTWSPARQLEngine
===============

An implementation of the SPARQL query language influenced by trait/role-based programming.
---------------

This code is a work-in-progress, aiming to implement a full SPARQL query and update engine
in Objective-C. The design is based heavily on trait/role-based programming, allowing for
natural extensibility and component selection/replacement (e.g. using the Rasqal SPARQL
parser and a triple-store backed by the OS X Address Book).
